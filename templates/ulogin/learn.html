  <h1>Creating Your First Blog Post</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Edu Blog platform! Creating a blog post is simple. Follow these steps to share your thoughts and ideas with our community.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Plan Your Content</h2>
  <p>Before you start writing, think about what you want to share. A great post starts with a great idea. It could be about a recent project, a new technology you've learned, or your thoughts on an industry trend.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Structure and Draft</h2>
  <p>Write your content with a clear structure in mind. This makes it easier for your audience to read and understand. A good structure includes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>A Catchy Title:</strong> This is the first thing people see. Make it interesting!</li>
    <li><strong>An Introduction:</strong> Briefly explain what the post is about and why it's important.</li>
    <li><strong>The Main Body:</strong> Elaborate on your topic with well-organized paragraphs, lists, and images.</li>
    <li><strong>A Conclusion:</strong> Summarize your main points and offer a final thought or a call to action.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Step 3: Use Formatting to Your Advantage</h2>
  <p>Use headings, bold text, and lists to break up your text and make it scannable. Our platform supports Markdown for simple formatting:</p>
  <div class="code-block">
# This is a main heading (H1)
## This is a sub-heading (H2)
   
This is a paragraph with **bold text** and *italic text*.

- This is a list item
- This is another list item
  </div>

  <h2>Step 4: Review and Publish</h2>
  <p>Once you're happy with your post, proofread it for any spelling or grammar errors. When it's ready, hit the "Publish" button to share it with the world. Congratulations!</p>
